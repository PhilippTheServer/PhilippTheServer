# Hi, I'm Philipp 👋

I like building infrastructure, mostly so I can break it again.

I'm an IT Security bachelor's student and Head of Administration & IT.
I run self-hosted systems, container platforms, and internal services — usually at a scale where things *will* go wrong if not designed properly.

Most of my time goes into:
- Running container-heavy infrastructures
- Automating everything that shouldn't be done twice
- Designing systems that survive bad ideas and worse deployments

## What I Do

I'm Head of Administration & IT with hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and operating production infrastructure since 2022. My work spans from bare-metal server architecture to container orchestration, automation pipelines, and full-stack internal tooling.

**Current Infrastructure:**
- 🐳 Docker standalone cluster managing:
- ☸️ Kubernetes cluster for orchestrated workloads
- 💾 Ceph storage cluster for distributed data
- 🌐 Internal network architecture (WireGuard VPN, Bind9 DNS)

I specialize in **containerization** and **infrastructure automation**, building scalable systems.

Applications that I maintain include:

HashiCorp Vault · Wazuh · OpenCTI · Keycloak · wiki.js · GitLab · Grafana/Prometheus · cAdvisor · NodeExporter · Nginx · Portainer · Nextcloud · Paperless-ngx · Wordpress · InfluxDB · MySQL · Postgresql · MongoDB · ArangoDB · Redis · Vaultwarden ·  Neo4j · Angular/Python/C++ custom builds and many more.

## Featured Project: Internal Operations Platform

I designed and maintain our company's internal platform — a full-stack application that centralized operations and replaced multiple external tools:

**Features:** Internal messenger · Time tracking · Ticket system · Accounting · Docker registry frontend · DNS management · WireGuard VPN management · Hosting orchestration

**Tech Stack:** Angular frontend · FastAPI backend · MySQL/InfluxDB · Celery workers

## Technical Expertise

### Infrastructure & Automation
I work across the full infrastructure lifecycle — from architecture design to deployment and day-2 operations.

**Container Orchestration:** Docker (expert), Kubernetes  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes manifests  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins, Portainer  
**Storage & Networking:** Ceph distributed storage, WireGuard, Bind9 DNS

### Software Development
I build internal services, APIs, and tooling to support infrastructure operations.

**Backend:** Python (FastAPI), C/C++  
**Frontend:** Angular (dashboards, management interfaces, internal tools)  
**Systems:** Linux expert (Debian, Arch), bare-metal & virtualized environments

Current side projects include an AI companion and various CLI tools for infrastructure management.

## Leadership & Community

**Managing Director · Open Skunkforce e.V.**  
I lead a small developer team and coordinate open-source initiatives. Once a year we host the embo++ and KiCon conferences in Germany - Bochum.

# What's Next

I'm currently focused on **large-scale infrastructure design**. I want to learn how to design and build data centers from scratch. 

*(Yes, I want to build a huge datacenter — and no, I have no idea how much of a pain it is going to be. But it is going to be a fun challenge.)*
